For most of the pandemic I logged my daily consumption, specifically the calorie and protein content. As I was trying to stay somewhat healthy, I wanted to be "data-driven" for my caloric intake. All of this was logged in a small note book. Broken down by "items", which were rolled up into meals.

For example, the following is what I would commonly have for breakfast, totaling to 340kcal, 35g protein.

| Item         | Serving (grams) | Calories (kcal) | Protein (grams) |
| ------------ | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |
| Greek yogurt |       170       |       90        |       20        |
| Apricot jam  |       15        |       30        |        0        |
| Special K    |       60        |       210       |       15        |
| Almond Milk  |       30        |       10        |        0        |

I'm slowly trying to transcribe months of consumption data into this application and eventually do some basic analysis on that data.
