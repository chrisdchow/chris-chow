It has been five months of fun-employment since the layoffs back in late April. I was still employed during the early months of the COVID-19 lock downs and I found remote work to be very difficult. Feast or famine productivity streaks complemented by waves of burn out and lack of healthy boundaries. There are a variety of reoccurring factors for that difficulty, such as diminished workforce morale, company dysfunction, and overall worldly chaos and discord. Working from home felt like a sisyphean endeavor.

The collective struggle-sharing of pandemic times combined with therapy helped me reframe "working from home" as "living at work." Where my home is no longer a haven or buffer from the outside world. Even now as I am working on personal projects and studying for interviews, I am still struggling with living at work. To really turn off after work, I would secure my work laptop in a desk drawer and then bike home. The physical separation and meaningful distance between work and home made for a very healthy balance.

Given that pandemic will endure well into 2021, I am concerned that I will continue to struggle with living at work especially when I am gainfully employed again.
