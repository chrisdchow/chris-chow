title: 'Abandoning a project'

During the first few weeks of pandemic fun-employment I tried to relax. However, I was not kind enough with myself and attempted to work on a project with a friend (as the sole software engineer). Due to a lack of personal motivation and interest, I abandoned the project. I certainly learned from that endeavor where I noted some technical learnings and takeaways in commit messages.

To respect the privacy of the project, I will avoid specifics of the project. This was a full stack web applications written using the Rails framework combined with server-side rendered React. I whipped up a small script written in Node to ETL the git commits from that project and have shared them as one of the projects (\<Redacted\>).
